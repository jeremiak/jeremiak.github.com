  <p class="col-12 md-col-7 md-pr1 mt2">One of the central questions in the 2018 federal midterm elections was who would win a majority in each chamber in Congress. I designed and developed a graphic to highlight some of the more contested races and allow readers to explore their own ideas about how each party might end up with control of the U.S. House.</p>
